# HTML Basic Elements - Favorites


## Overview
In this lab we're going to create a simple HTML page that displays a small amount of content describing an interesting topic.

The topic can be about anything. For example, tigers, cars, soccer balls... whatever you want.

Your page is going to display the following content:

* title - My Favorite [topic]
* description - loremipsum text as a place-holder where you would describe your topic.
* two images, including a short title, that describes a photo about the topic.

## Mockup
Below is a mock-up of what the page should look like.
